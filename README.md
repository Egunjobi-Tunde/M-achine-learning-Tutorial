# Machine learning Tutorial
 A simple Machine Learning Tutorial

Four types of Supervised Machine Learning Models were used
In this tutorial on each model the basic steps of data analysis were adopted

# DATA IMPORTATION
# DATA CLEANING
# DATA VISUALIZATION/ INSIGHT
# TRAINING OF MODEL
# PREDICTION BASED ON THE TRAINED MODEL.

# (1) LOGISTIC REGRESSION

SUV dataset from Kaggle was used to train a model to determine whether a customer will buy an SUV car or not
based on some features like Age, Gender, and Estimated Salary.

# (2) LINEAR REGRESSION 

Analysis and Prediction were made on Students Mark based on Time spent studying.
A model was Trained which was used to predict students' scores based on time-spent studying

(3) &(4)

# DECISION TREE AND RANDOM FOREST.

Both were used on the Iris dataset 
Models were trained using each of the methods with high accuracy
